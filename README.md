## AI Virtual Mouse

> I've devised an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solution to manipulate mouse movements utilizing Python and OpenCV. This system employs a real-time camera to identify and track hand landmarks, allowing for the interpretation of gesture patterns as opposed to relying on a traditional physical mouse.

## Dependencies  -
